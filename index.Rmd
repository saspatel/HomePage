## Bio

I'm an undergraduate student currently specializing in statistics. I've recently been interested in using my knowledge of statistics in the public health space. Specifically, I hope to work in the pharmaceutical trial process or aid in the discovery of new technologies that can either diagnose or treat diseases. I have also had an interest in neuroscience given the complexity of the brain and how mathematics/statistics might be able to model it. Lastly, my goal is to eventually go to graduate school to pursue my PhD.
