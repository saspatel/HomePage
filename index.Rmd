## Bio

Thanks for wanting to get to know me a bit better! I am a student at the University of Toronto (St. George campus) studying the theory of statistics and computer science. I would love to work in academia or financial technology when I'm older, however the world of statistics is so incredibly diverse that I'm not sure exactly what I want to do! A quick synopsis of my work life is below, but check out my CV, blog posts, and more on my main website!
