## Bio

I'm an undergraduate student currently specializing in statistical theory and minoring in mathematics. I've recently been interested in using my knowledge of statistics in the public health space. Specifically, I hope to aid in the discovery of new technologies that can either diagnose or treat diseases. I am also interested in machine learning and its uses in the medical field. As a result, I'm currently using machine learning at the Pardee Lab to better understand protein structures.
