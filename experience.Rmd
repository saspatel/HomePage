## Predictnow.ai
Consultant (04/2021 - )

As a feature engineer at [Predictnow.ai](https://predictnow.ai), I was responsible for developing and implementing visuals that would allow people to understand the information from the machine learning model powering the website. The visualizations presented averaged SHAP values (if you don't know what those are, [this](https://towardsdatascience.com/shap-explained-the-way-i-wish-someone-explained-it-to-me-ab81cc69ef30) is a good intro) across each cross validation fold. Furthermore, as a feature engineer I read and research existing financial methods and implement my own statistical analysis to determine whether new relevant features can be derived. Working at Predictnow.ai has also afforded me the opportunity to start learning about the industry from the resources created by [Dr. Chan](https://www.epchan.com/). These resources have provided me a great foundation of skills within the field of quantitative finance that I hope to apply in the future.

## 00100100 Factory

I have lead the development of our flagship trading bot now managing $500,000+ in our user's assets. Currently, the goal is to incorporate then provide users with access to the bots to use. The bots run a simple strategy focused on exploiting the volatility of cryptocurrencies on the Kraken exchange.
