The visualizations presented averaged SHAP values (if you don’t know what those are, this is a good intro) across each cross validation fold. Furthermore, as a feature engineer I read and research existing financial methods and implement my own statistical analysis to determine whether new relevant features can be derived. Working at Predictnow.ai has also afforded me the opportunity to start learning about the industry from the resources created by Dr. Chan. These resources have provided me a great foundation of skills within the field of quantitative finance that I hope to apply in the future.\n00100100 Factory\nDeveloper (03/2021 - )\nAs a developer at 00100100, I am learning invaluable skills about the field of quantitative finance. I have lead the development of our flagship trading bot now managing $500,000+ in our user’s assets. Currently, the goal is to incorporate then provide users with access to the bots to use. The bots run a simple strategy focused on exploiting the volatility of cryptocurrencies on the Kraken exchange.\n\n\n\n",

Given the complexity of the subway system, its believed the delays are inevitable, however any underlying patters in the subway delay, might indicate that there are factors affecting the delay that could be controlled.”\nModeling Short Term Insider Trades\nResearch Proposal - Methodology Flow Chart - Analysis\nThis project was designed to attempt to model short changes in a stocks price after a prominent member of that company bought or sold shares of that stock. However, due to the nature of the project, a linear regression was a requirement and it ended up resulting in a poorly fitting model. As a result, no conclusion could be formed about the use of the used variables in developing a reliable trading strategy.\n\n\n\n",
