I have hosted small presentations on the uses of machine learning in chemical discoveries, and am currently working on using machine learning to better understand protein structure. As the only statistician on the team, I plan on primarily using generative models (GANs and VAEs) to help the lab accomplish their research goals.\nPredictnow.ai\nConsultant (04/2021 - )\nAs a feature engineer at Predictnow.ai, I was responsible for developing and implementing visuals that would allow people to understand the information from the machine learning model powering the website. The visualizations presented averaged SHAP values (if you don’t know what those are, this is a good intro) across each cross validation fold. Furthermore, as a feature engineer I read and research existing financial methods and implement my own statistical analysis to determine whether new relevant features can be derived. Working at Predictnow.ai has also afforded me the opportunity to start learning about the finance industry from the resources created by Dr. Chan. These resources have provided me a great foundation of skills within the field of quantitative finance that I hope to apply in the future.\n00100100 Factory\nDeveloper (03/2021 - )\nAs a developer at 00100100, I am learning invaluable skills about the field of quantitative finance. I have lead the development of our flagship trading bot now managing $500,000+ in our user’s assets. Currently, the goal is to incorporate then provide users with access to the bots to use. The bots run a simple strategy focused on exploiting the volatility of cryptocurrencies on the Kraken exchange.\n\n\n\n",

However, there exists a major vulnerability exploited by the use of adversarial attacks. An adversarial attack imputes images by altering the input image very slightly, making it nearly undetectable to the naked eye, but results in a very different classification by the network. This paper explores the projected gradient descent (PGD) attack and the Adaptive Mask Segmentation Attack (ASMA) on the image segmentation DeepLabV3 model using two types of architectures: MobileNetV3 and ResNet50, It was found that PGD was very consistent in changing the segmentation to be its target while the generalization of ASMA to a multiclass target was not as effective. The existence of such attack however puts all of image classification deep learning networks in danger of exploitation.”\nPredicting the 2025 Canadian Federal Election\npdf\nCoauthored with: Johnson Vo, Vincent Chu, and Zhenning Guam\n“Using two datasets, we’ve developed a method under a multilevel regression with post-stratification (MRP) approach in order to answer the question of which party will be the most likely to win the 2025 Canadian federal election.” As a result of this data being gathered years ahead of the election, the same analysis on more recent data is the next step.\nToronto Delay Subway Analysis\npdf\n“So how do we decide where the subway system might need revisions? Given the complexity of the subway system, its believed the delays are inevitable, however any underlying patters in the subway delay, might indicate that there are factors affecting the delay that could be controlled.”\nModeling Short Term Insider Trades\nResearch Proposal - Methodology Flow Chart - Analysis\nThis project was designed to attempt to model short changes in a stocks price after a prominent member of that company bought or sold shares of that stock. However, due to the nature of the project, a linear regression was a requirement and it ended up resulting in a poorly fitting model. As a result, no conclusion could be formed about the use of the used variables in developing a reliable trading strategy.\n\n\n\n",
